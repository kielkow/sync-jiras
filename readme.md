This glossary will be a quick guide for all technical terms inside our platform.

### Function
Functions are a static piece of code that can be reused any number of times in your integrations. 
They will expect an input and a return output based on the data sent. All functions will be under your personal Catalog.

### Data-Transformation
Data-transformations are responsible for converting a Payload returned from a Resource and make it understandable 
to another Resource to connect with.

### Automation
An Automation is a complete integration flow. The automation orchestrates all the resources, functions,
data-transformation on your catalog and the SDK to make all the requests and logical rules needed.

### Trigger
The Triggers are responsible to make you Automation run. Just choose an Automation, the payload that will be
used, and how often you want it to run.
